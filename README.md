# PyBer Ride Data Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this project is to analyze the Pyber ride and city data to gain insights on how the ride count and fares vary by the city types. The analysis is done using pandas dataframes and the graph is plotted using matplotlib.

## Results

The Pyber ride data by dates and city is used for this analysis. As shown in the summary below, the total rides, drivers and fares are highest in the urban cities, and lowest in the rural cities. However, the average fares per ride and driver are the lowest in the urban cities and highest in the rural cities.

Looking at the weekly trend for a sample data from Jan to April 2019, there has been demands and lulls across all the three city types. In urban and Suburban city types, inspite of the ups and downs in the demand, the fares have risen.

## Summary

Based on the analysis, below are the recommendations

* Increase the drivers in rural areas, since the rural areas have less drivers
* Decrease the fare in rural areas. They seem to have the highest average fare per ride. Decreasing the fare can make it more affordable
* Increase drivers in urban cities. Since Urban cities are doing very well, increasing the drivers would bring in more revenue
